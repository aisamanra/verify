# Verify â€” Lightweight, General-Purpose Code Signing

**WARNING**: `verify` is still in the experimental phase. **Do not
use this yet!**

The `verify` script is a small script that intends to make the
unfortunately common pattern of installing software using
`curl | sh` more secure. The `verify` script is a very small
interface on top of OpenBSD's
[signify](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify)
code-signing tool
that fits in the middle of pipelines, letting you transform
the insecure pipeline

~~~.sh
$ curl some-package | sh
~~~

to the more secure

~~~.sh
$ curl some-package.verified | verify | sh
~~~

which will not execute the downloaded program if the package
has not been signed by a trusted key. The keys used by
[signify](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify)
are
[Ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/index.html) keys, and
therefore are very small and can be easily stored and
distributed in numerous ways.

Additionally, if you don't have the public key that signed a
package, and want to trust a package _just this one time_,
there's a script that can execute verified packages without
checking to see if they are trusted first.

~~~.sh
$ curl some-package.verified | trust | sh
~~~

## Running the Example

Make sure that OpenBSD's `signify` is somewhere in your `$PATH`.
Create a directory `$HOME/.trusted` and copy the public key
`example/sample-key.pub` to that directory. Afterwards, you'll
be able to download the sample script and execute its (trivial)
command:

~~~.sh
$ curl https://github.com/aisamanra/verify/raw/master/example/sample-payload.tar | verify | sh
If you can read this, then it has been verified.
~~~

If you delete that trusted key, then running the same command
will result in an error.

## Building your Own Packages

Assuming you have a signify public/private keypair already:
run the script `sign.sh` with your private key, the name of the
executable file you want to sign, and the location where
you want the output to be.

~~~.sh
$ >my-script.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

echo Hello, world!
EOF
$ sign my-private-key ./my-script ./my-package.verified
~~~
